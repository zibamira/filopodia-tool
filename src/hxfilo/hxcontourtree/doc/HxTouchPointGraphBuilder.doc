\begin{hxdescription}
  This module is based on the \link{HxPropagateContours}{PropagateContours}
  module. Given a starting set of contours (seeding points) it keeps track of
  the voxels lying on the border of each contour, and stores them in a global
  Heap data structure. Then the border voxel with the maximal value is labeled
  and adjoined to its corresponding contour. The unlabeled neighbours of the
  voxel are added to the current set of border voxels. If among the neighbours
  of the voxel there are voxels belonging to different contours, that voxel is
  considered to be a touching point. The propagation stops either when the first
  touching point is met or when a touching point with a value below a
  user-defined {\em Scalar threshold} is met. Once the propagation of the
  contours is over, it then builds a spatial graph, which contains the starting
  points, the corresponding maximal points and the touching points between
  different regions.

\begin{hxconnections}
    \hxlabel{HxTouchPointGraphBuilder_data}
    \hxport{Data}{\tt [required]}\\
    The image data to be segmented.

\end{hxconnections}

\begin{hxports}
    \hxlabel{HxTouchPointGraphBuilder_StopAt}
    \hxport{Stop at}\\
    \hximage{HxTouchPointGraphBuilder_StopAt}\\
    This option sets the stopping condition for the propagation.

    \hxlabel{HxTouchPointGraphBuilder_ScalarThreshold}
    \hxport{Scalar threshold}\\
    \hximage{HxTouchPointGraphBuilder_ScalarThreshold}\\
    If the {\em Stop at} option is set to {\em Threshold}, then when a touching
    point with a value lower than this threshold is met, the propagation of the
    contours stops.

    \hxlabel{HxTouchPointGraphBuilder_DisplayThreshold}
    \hxport{Display threshold}\\
    \hximage{HxTouchPointGraphBuilder_DisplayThreshold}\\
    When multiple touching points are displayed, you can hide all the touching
    points with a value lower than this threshold.

    \hxlabel{HxTouchPointGraphBuilder_pointList}
    \hxport{Point}\\
    \hximage{HxTouchPointGraphBuilder_pointList}\\
    The points from which the propagation of the contours begins.

    \hxlabel{HxTouchPointGraphBuilder_pointSize}
    \hxport{Point size}\\
    \hximage{HxTouchPointGraphBuilder_pointSize}\\
    The size of the points in the 3D View.

\end{hxports}
