\begin{hxdescription}
 With the \textit{MergeSpatialGraphs} module you can merge
 multiple spatial graphs from a selected directory into a
 timedependend graph.\\
 The output graph includes all components (vertices,
 segments, labels and Attributes) of the spatial
 graphs stored in the selected folder. Additionally, a new 
 hierarchical label group "\textit{Time Step}" is added.
 Each spatial gets its own time ID on condition that the
 filenames include a time expression (see below).
