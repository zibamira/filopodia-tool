\begin{hxdescription}
  This module segments out regions in the image by growing contours starting at
  different seeding points. Given a starting set of contours (which can be
  either single points or labeled regions), it keeps track of the voxels lying 
  on the border of each contour, and stores them in a global Heap data
  structure. Then the border voxel with the maximal value is labeled and
  adjoined to its corresponding contour. The unlabeled neighbours of the voxel
  are added to the current set of border voxels. If among the neighbours of the
  voxel there are voxels belonging to different contours, that voxel is
  considered to be a touching point. The propagation stops either when the first
  touching point is met or when a touching point with a value below a
  user-defined {\em Scalar threshold} is met.

\begin{hxconnections}
    \hxlabel{HxPropagateContours_data}
    \hxport{Data}{\tt [required]}\\
    The image data to be segmented.

    \hxlabel{HxPropagateContours_labelSeed}
    \hxport{Label seed}{\tt [optional]}\\
    The seeding label field.

    \hxlabel{HxPropagateContours_landmarkSeeds}
    \hxport{Landmark Seeds}{\tt [optional]}\\
    The seeding landmarks.

\end{hxconnections}

\begin{hxports}
    \hxlabel{HxPropagateContours_StopAt}
    \hxport{Stop at}\\
    \hximage{HxPropagateContours_StopAt}\\
    This option sets the stopping condition for the propagation.

    \hxlabel{HxPropagateContours_ScalarThreshold}
    \hxport{Scalar threshold}\\
    \hximage{HxPropagateContours_ScalarThreshold}\\
    If the {\em Stop at} option is set to {\em Threshold}, then when a touching
    point with a value lower than this threshold is met, the propagation of the
    contours stops.

    \hxlabel{HxPropagateContours_SeedFrom}
    \hxport{Seed from}\\
    \hximage{HxPropagateContours_SeedFrom}\\
    This option sets the seeding mode: single points, or labeled regions.

    \hxlabel{HxPropagateContours_Mode}
    \hxport{Mode}\\
    \hximage{HxPropagateContours_Mode}\\
    For landmark-based seeding, three modes are available.
    First, the {\em scalar value} mode, which is the normal
    mode that considers only the scalar value.
    Second, the {\em scalar value + dist} mode.
    This mode modulates the scalar value with the Euclidean
    distance from the landmark by dividing the value by
    the (distance + 1), that is, value / (distance + 1).
    Third, {\em dist}, only the distance is considered.
    That means that 1/(distance + 1) replaces the original
    scalar value.

    \hxlabel{HxPropagateContours_pointList}
    \hxport{Point}\\
    \hximage{HxPropagateContours_pointList}\\
    The points from which the propagation of the contours begins.

    \hxlabel{HxPropagateContours_pointSize}
    \hxport{Point size}\\
    \hximage{HxPropagateContours_pointSize}\\
    The size of the points in the 3D View.
