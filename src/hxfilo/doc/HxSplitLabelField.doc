\hxlabel{HxSplitLabelField}
\hxfeatureid{HxSplitLabelField}

\begin{hxdescription}
 The module \textit{SplitLabelField} crops a 3D label image
 around each object. It is required that all objects have
 their own label. For each label the cropping window encloses
 the extend of the labeled object. Additionally, a boundary
 can be set expanding the window in each direction by the
 chosen number of voxels.\\
 The output contains the a cropped label image for each
 object.
\end{hxdescription}

\begin{hxconnections}
\hxlabel{HxSplitLabelField_data}
\hxport{Data}{\tt [required]}\\
 The input label image to be analyzed.
 
\hxlabel{HxSplitLabelField_Image}
\hxport{Image}{\tt [optional]}\\
 Providing an intensity image, also the image will be
 cropped in the same size as the label image.

\hxlabel{HxSplitLabelField_Seeds}
\hxport{Seeds}{\tt [optional]}\\
 You can also add a spatial graph containing a vertice in
 each label you are interested in. You can for example use
 the filament editor, add a new spatial graph and set new
 nodes in the gray scale image within the objects of
 interests.

\begin{hxports}
\hxlabel{HxSplitLabelField_BoundarySize}
\hxport{Boundary size}\\
\hximage{HxSplitLabelField_BoundarySize}\\
 The boundary size expands the cropping window by the set
 number of voxels

\hxlabel{HxSplitLabelField_ImageBackground}
\hxport{Image background}\\
\hximage{HxSplitLabelField_ImageBackground}\\
 If you add an intensity image you can decide how to handle
 the image background. Two options are offered:
 
 \begin {itemize}
 \item \textbf{Keep intensity}: Intensity of backgound
 voxels is kept.
 \item \textbf{Set to background}: Intensity of backgound
 voxels will be set to 0.
