    - @c predEdge is a pointer to the last edge of the current shortest 
    path to this vertex
    - @c edges is the list of outgoing edges

    The class @c McDijkstraShortestPath provides two static functions
    to compute the shortest path between two specified vertices, and
    the shortest paths between a single specified vertex and all other
    vertices, respectively. Note that, since we use pointers to the
    edges in our implementation, some care needs to be taken when
    creating the edges. You <em> must not </em> resize (or append an
    item to) the array after adding edges to the array, i.e., after
    assiging any pointers to elements in the array.
    
    The shortest path(s) is (are) only given implicetely and can be
    computed by backtracking from the end vertex using the @c predEdge
    pointer. The @c startVertex of @c predEdge is the predecessor of a
    vertex along the shortest path to this vertex.

    The implementation of the algorithms is based on the book
    "Algorithmic graph theory" by James A. McHugh.
