\hxlabel{HxCreateContourTree}
\hxpackname{amira}

\begin{hxdescription}
  This module creates both the contour tree and the augmented contour
  tree of a scalar field.  Since the contour tree is computed starting
  from the maxima of the field, it is assumed that the objects of
  interest have higher scalar values than the background.
\end{hxdescription}

\begin{hxconnections}
  \hxlabel{HxCreateContourTree_data}
  \hxport{Data}{\tt [required]}\\
  The image data given as scalar field.
\end{hxconnections}

\begin{hxports}
  \hxlabel{HxCreateContourTree_threshold}
  \hxport{Threshold}\\
  \hximage{HxCreateContourTree_threshold}\\
  The contour tree is truncated such that only voxel with values
  larger than the given threshold are considered.

  \hxlabel{HxCreateContourTree_trees}
  \hxport{Trees}\\
  \hximage{HxCreateContourTree_trees}\\
  The contour tree is computed from the join and the split tree.  If
  these two trees are of interest, they can be output by selecting the
  {\em join tree} or the {\em split tree} option, respectively.
\end{hxports}
