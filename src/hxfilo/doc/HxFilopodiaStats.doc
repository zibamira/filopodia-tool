\begin{hxdescription}
 The \textit{Filopodia Statistic} module can be connected to
 a spatial graph representing a reconstructed growth cone.
 The module computes and analyse various features of the
 filopodia like life time, length, and speed and list them 
 into spread sheets. 
\end{hxdescription}

\begin{hxconnections}
\hxlabel{HxFilopodiaStats_data}
\hxport{Data}{\tt [required]}\\
 Filopodia Spatial Graph with following label groups:
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item Filopodia
 	\item Time Step
    \item Node Type
    \item Location
    \item Manual Node Match
    \item Manual Geometry
 \end{itemize}

\end{hxconnections}

\begin{hxports}
\hxlabel{HxFilopodiaStats_output}
\hxport{Output}\\
\hximage{HxFilopodiaStats_output}\\
 The \textit{Filopodia Statistic} module can return up to
 three spread sheets containing the computed filopodia and 
 filament properties:
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item \textit{Filament Statistic}\\
    We call a filopodium at a specific timestep a filament.
	For each filament the time step of appearance, the
    length, the angle related to the root node, the base and
    tip position as well as the assigned filopodia ID is
    stored.  
    \item \textit{Filopodia Statistic}\\
    This table stores for each filopodium the first, last
    time step of appearence and the resulting life time.
	Additionally, various statical information about the
    filopodia length is computed. First, the mean and final
    length as well as the standard deviation of all
    filaments assigned to the filopodia is calculated. Also 
    the number of extention events (filopodia is longer than
    before), retraction events (filopodia is shorter than
    before) and stabilizations (length change is smaller
    than a chosen threshold) are stored.
    \item \textit{Length Statistic}\\
    For each filopodium the filament length in each time step
    is listed. This table can be used to compute heat maps
    displaying the change in length over time depending on 
 	the orientation of the filopodium.
 \end{itemize}
 
 The table of interests can be chosen by
 checking the relevant check boxes.

\hxlabel{HxFilopodiaStats_StabilizationThreshold}
\hxport{Stabilization Threshold}\\
\hximage{HxFilopodiaStats_StabilizationThreshold}\\
 The user can choose a stabilization threshold. If the
 length of a filopodium in two timesteps differs less than
 the given threshold the event is classified as stable.

\hxlabel{HxFilopodiaStats_action}
\hxport{Action}\\
\hximage{HxFilopodiaStats_action}\\
 Pressing the action button starts computation of filopodia
 statistic and shows all spread sheets chosen by the user.
