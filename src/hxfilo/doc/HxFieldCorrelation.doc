\begin{hxdescription}
 The \textit{FieldCorrelation} module computes the
 normailzed cross corrlation (NCC) between an image and a 
 given template. To minimize the computing time a search
 window can be set by defining the size and the start
 voxel of the window. The template center is shifted to
 all voxel centers within the search window on discrete steps.
 At each position the NCC is computed using the ITK
 (Johnson, 2013) implementation.\\
 The result is a 3D uniform scalar field with the size of
 the search window with values in the range from -1 to 1,
 where +1 indicates the strongest possible agreement and -1
 the strongest possible disagreement. 0 indicates no
 relation at all.\\
 You can analyze the result by using e.g. \textit{Regional
 Maxima} to find the maximum correlation in the search area.

\hxlabel{HxFieldCorrelation_data}
\hxport{Data}{\tt [required]}\\
 Input must be 3D scalar field with unsigned chars or floats.

\hxport{Template}{\tt [required]}\\
 Template must be 3D scalar field with unsigned chars or
 floats.

\begin{hxports}
\hxlabel{HxFieldCorrelation_Start}
\hxport{Start}\\
\hximage{HxFieldCorrelation_Start}\\
 Set the start voxel position of the 3D search window.\\
 You can use the cropping tool to estimate a reasonable
 window and use the \textit{min index} as start coordinates.
 \\\\

\hxlabel{HxFieldCorrelation_Size}
\hxport{Size}\\
\hximage{HxFieldCorrelation_Size}\\
 Define the size of the 3D search window to decrease
 computing time.\\
 If new image data is connected the size will be
 automatically set to the image size.
 You can use the cropping tool to estimate a reasonable
 window and use the difference between \textit{min index}
 and \textit{max index} as search window size.\\\\
